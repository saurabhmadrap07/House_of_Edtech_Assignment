# üé¨ React Native Expo WebView & Video Player App

A **modern, robust, and educational** React Native project demonstrating an end-to-end, real-world app architecture with **WebView integration**, a feature-rich **custom video player**, local notifications, dark/light theming, and best practices with TypeScript and Expo SDK 53+.

---

## üåü Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive reference and learning asset for developers:
- It demonstrates how to build a multi-screen mobile app with **professional video streaming**, **web browsing**, app-wide **notifications**, and adaptable user interface.
- The **app architecture and code** are suited for use in production projects as well as portfolio works.
- All major features are tested and ready for deployment on both Android and iOS (using Expo Go and EAS Build).

## üöÄ Full Feature List

### **Navigation**
- Stack navigation for managing multiple screens (WebView and Video Player)
- Smooth, modern screen transitions

### **WebView Screen**
- Embedded browser using React Native WebView component
- Pull-to-refresh gesture on the web content
- Default page: [reactnative.dev](https://reactnative.dev) (changeable for other URLs)
- Notification actions:
  - Manual "Show Welcome Notification" button (fires after 3s)
  - Manual "Show Video Available" notification (fires after 4s)
  - Bonus: **Automatically fires welcome notification when page finishes loading**

### **Video Player Screen**
- **Advanced HLS streaming** using Expo AV (to be migrated to expo-video)
- **Multiple video streams**: Easily switch between sources (examples: Mux, Big Buck Bunny)
- **Professional, single-row control bar** including:
  - Play/Pause (toggle and responsive), also toggle by tapping video area
  - Current time and remaining time display
  - Seek slider with drag-to-seek
  - Volume/Mute toggle
  - Fullscreen toggle (with native fullscreen on mobile)
  - Stream switching buttons (switches instantly)
- **Loading and buffering indicators** with spinner overlay
- Error handling with user feedback for network or playback issues
- **Modern, responsive UI design**: Icons and controls visible in all themes and adapt to screen size

### **Theming and Responsiveness**
- Automatic **dark and light theme** support matching device settings
- Layout adapts for phones and tablets, portrait and landscape

### **Notifications**
- Uses Expo Notifications API for **local notifications** (fully compatible with Expo Go)
- Permission management (asks user for notification permissions)
- Notifications can play sounds if triggered

### **State Management and Best Practices**
- Uses React Context for handling notification logic (clean, scalable)
- Modular separation of screens, components, and utilities
- Full TypeScript typing for safety and maintainability

### **Build, Testing, and Distribution**
- "expo start" for local dev and device testing
- EAS Build for generating APK (android) or AAB for Google Play
- Doctor and automated checks for early error detection

- All controls (play/pause, seek, time, mute, fullscreen, stream switch) shown in one row under video
- Responsive across all screen sizes and orientations
